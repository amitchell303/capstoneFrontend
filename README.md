# Site Status


# MyMoto/Capstone Frontend

Deployed site: https://fsa-capstone-frontend-5a11747f8eba.herokuapp.com/

MyMoto is a web application that helps vehicle owners stay organized and better communicate with mechanics. Users can log both personal service entries— such as oil changes performed themselves— and professional service summaries provided by mechanics. During a visit, owners can share their vehicle history with a mechanic, giving them full context. Afterward, the mechanic can add a professional summary of the work performed.
